<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>
  This repository contains a C++ program designed to determine whether two lists share any common elements. The algorithm creates copies of the lists, modifies one list, and checks for differences to ascertain commonality. It operates with a time complexity of Î©(n), ensuring efficient evaluation proportional to the size of the input lists.
